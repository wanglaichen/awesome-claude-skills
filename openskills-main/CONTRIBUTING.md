# Contributing to OpenSkills

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenSkills!

## Code Standards

- **TypeScript:** All code must be TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Testing:** Include tests for new functionality (we use vitest)
- **Documentation:** Update README.md for user-facing changes
- **Modular design:** Keep functions focused and under 50 lines
- **Minimal dependencies:** Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch
2. **Write clear commit messages** explaining the "why" not just "what"
3. **Include tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** (README.md, docs/)
5. **Ensure all checks pass** (typecheck, test, build)
6. **Submit PR** with clear description of changes
